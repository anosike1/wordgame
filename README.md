In our WORD GAME, we'll be guessing the computer's SECRET word using a couple of clues.

If a letter from the word we guessed is also a letter in the secret word, it will appear in the clue:
- as uppercase if it is in the same position in both words OR
- as lowercase if it is in a different position in the secret word.
